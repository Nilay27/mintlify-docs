## Role of EigenCompute

- Provides a **restaked security layer** for the CoFHE processor workload.
- Coordinates **task assignment, quorum selection, and signature aggregation** for each batch.
- Offers **fault reporting and slashing hooks** when operators fail to decrypt, simulate, or sign correctly.

## Task Lifecycle

1. **Fetch batch** — Operator reads the epoch buffer and intent Merkle root from the hook.
2. **Decrypt (permitted)** — Uses the CoFHE processor to open ciphertexts where permissions exist.
3. **Simulate UTI** — Runs Universal Trade Intent simulations for candidate routes and risk rails.
4. **Match & net** — Aggregates intents, nets opposing flow, computes internal transfers and net public swap.
5. **Attest** — Produces a receipt containing batchId, net swap, internal transfers, and policy verdicts; signs it for quorum aggregation.
6. **Submit** — Posts the signed bundle back to the hook; on success, settlement updates encrypted balances and executes the net swap.

## Operator Requirements

- **Keys**: CoFHE secret key (in enclave/HSM), EigenCompute staking keys, and signing key for attestations.
- **Connectivity**: Access to the chosen CoFHE processor endpoint, Ethereum RPC for the hook, and any L2 RPCs used in UTI simulation.
- **Observability**: Metrics for decrypt latency, match rate, and attestation success; logs for policy failures.

## Batching & Matching

- **Epoch-based**: Intents are grouped into epochs (configurable duration).
- **Cross-intent netting**: Internal transfers update encrypted balances directly; only the net delta hits the AMM.
- **Order fairness**: Enforce deadlines, size bounds, and token allowlists before including an intent in the batch.

## Faults & Recovery

- **Decrypt failures**: If a quorum cannot decrypt, the batch is skipped and intents roll forward.
- **Policy failures**: Intents violating bounds are flagged and excluded; batch still proceeds with valid intents.
- **Challenge window**: Attestations can be challenged; slashing escalates through EigenCompute’s fault handlers.

## Outputs to the Frontend

- Batch receipts include: `batchId`, matched pairs, net swap amounts, per-intent settlement handles, and operator set IDs.
- Frontend polls receipts and updates user-facing states (queued → simulating → settling → finalized).
