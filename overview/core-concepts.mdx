description: How AlphaEngine uses a CoFHE processor and EigenCompute operators to deliver private, batched trading on Uniswap v4
---

<Callout>
  AlphaEngine routes trades through a **CoFHE processor** and settles netted
  flow on Uniswap v4 with **EigenCompute** operator attestations. We use
  “CoFHE processor” as the generic abstraction throughout.
</Callout>

## What is AlphaEngine?

- **Private by default**: Users encrypt intents client-side; ciphertexts are queued and settled without exposing amounts or directions on-chain.
- **Batched & netted**: Multiple trades roll into epochs, matched off-chain, and only the net swap touches the pool, reducing gas and MEV surface.
- **Attested execution**: Restaked EigenCompute operators decrypt (when permitted), simulate Universal Trade Intents (UTI), sign results, and the contracts verify quorum before settlement.

## Why this design

- **End-to-end privacy**: No plaintext amounts in mempool; ciphertext handles only.
- **Fair batching**: Epoch-based matching reduces leakage and improves execution quality.
- **Modular compute**: Swap between CoFHE providers without changing contracts.
- **Operator accountability**: Signature quorum + challenge paths ensure correctness.

## Key Flows

- **Intent submission**: Users encrypt `amount`, `tokenIn`, `tokenOut`, `minOut`, and `deadline` via the frontend SDK, then submit to the hook.
- **Batch processing**: The hook groups intents into epochs, grants decrypt rights to the operator quorum, and exposes batch roots.
- **UTI simulation & matching**: Operators simulate Universal Trade Intents over candidate routes, net opposing flow, and produce a signed result bundle.
- **Settlement**: The hook verifies signatures, applies encrypted internal transfers, and executes only the net swap on-chain. Events carry ciphertext handles for updated balances.

## Where to go next

- Start with the [Quickstart](/guides/quickstart) to run the stack locally.
- Read the [CoFHE processor primer](/compute/cofhe-coprocessor) to understand encryption, permissions, and performance expectations.
- Dive into [System Architecture](/architecture/system-architecture) and [EigenCompute & Operators](/compute/eigencompute-operators) to see how batching, matching, and attestations work.
