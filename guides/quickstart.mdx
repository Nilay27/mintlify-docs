title: Quickstart
description: Spin up AlphaEngine locally with the CoFHE processor and EigenCompute operator
---
---

## What you get

- Uniswap v4 hook + shielded vault for encrypted balances and intents.
- CoFHE processor integration for encrypted math and controlled decrypts.
- EigenCompute operator flow for simulation, matching, and attested settlement.
- Frontend that encrypts orders client-side and tracks batch lifecycle.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm or npm
- Hardhat (Foundry optional for testing)
- Git + a working RPC (e.g., Anvil or Sepolia)

## Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/alphaengine.git
cd alphaengine

# Install hook + AVS deps (use pnpm or npm)
pnpm install
```

## Run locally (suggested terminals)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="1) Local chain">
    ```bash
    anvil
    ```
    Starts a devnet for contracts and hook deployment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code" title="2) Deploy hook + vault">
    ```bash
    cd packages/fhevm-hardhat-template
    npx hardhat node            # optional if you want a separate node process
    npx hardhat deploy --network localhost
    ```
    Deploys the AlphaEngine contracts to the local chain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="server" title="3) Start EigenCompute operator">
    ```bash
    cd packages/fhevm-hardhat-template/avs
    pnpm install
    pnpm run start:operator
    ```
    Brings up the operator that pulls batches, decrypts (as allowed), simulates, and attests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="browser" title="4) Frontend">
    ```bash
    cd packages/site   # UI package path
    pnpm install
    pnpm run dev
    # open http://localhost:3000
    ```
    Encrypts intents in-browser, submits multiple trades per epoch, and shows batch states.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Configure the CoFHE processor

- Set the public key in the frontend config so clients encrypt with the correct key.
- Point the operator to the coprocessor endpoint. Keep private keys in an enclave/HSM.
- Align batch duration and max intents per batch to your latency/privacy trade-offs.

## Experience the Flow

- Deposit tokens → receive encrypted balances.
- Submit multiple encrypted intents in one session (e.g., USDC→USDT, USDT→DAI).
- Watch the operator pick up the batch, simulate, and attest.
- See only the net swap hit the pool; decrypt balances locally to view results.

<Callout>
  Deployments may differ from local mocks. The docs describe full intended
  functionality; align configs with your chosen coprocessor and network.
